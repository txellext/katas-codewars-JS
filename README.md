### ⭐ Introduction
<br>

Solutions with tests and tutorials for <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a> katas.

-What's a Kata?
It is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire (JS in this repo)

-What is Kyu?
It is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform

-and a codewarrior?
A codewarrior is the user/coder who practice katas in Codewars. 


### 🦋 Goals
<br>

Being a Codewarrior and practicing katas helped me to improve my algorithmic thinking.

Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at your solutions to Kata until we have completed it ourselves.
